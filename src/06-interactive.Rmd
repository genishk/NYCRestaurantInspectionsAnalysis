[Find Safe Restaurants](https://vishweshwar.shinyapps.io/NYCRestaurantsInspectionAnalysis/)

We have created an interactive map using the leaftlet package with the shiny framework. 

The map helps people track down crucial information about a restaurant, such as the total number of inspections they've undergone, their latest inspection score, last inspected date, number of critical violations and most frequently violated codes. 

This information can be extracted for various time periods, starting from 2016 to 2021 and leading up to 2021. The user can also narrow down their search depending on their choice of cuisine and the borough they're located. We have also provided a slide bar to shortlist restaurants depending on their latest inspection score. Remember, the lower the better!

We hope this map will help New Yorkers make an informed decision before eating out.
