Our motivation for choosing this is to analyze and summarize essential information present in this dataset, which would help the public make informed decisions while choosing which restaurant to eat in in New York City. Since we will be on the lookout for patterns, it will also help us understand which areas in NYC are lagging in terms of safety. Hence, this dataset will help us answer the following questions:

q1: What are the most common violations committed? 

q2: How do non-chain restaurants compare to their counterparts, i.e., chain restaurants?

q3: What are the locations in NYC that have a large number of critical violations?

We will be using the 'DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results' dataset available on NYC Open Data for this project. The dataset contains details on violation citations against restaurants from every inspection conducted by the NYC government. It consists of features about restaurants details such as a unique ID, their name, zip code and borough in which they're located. It also consists of further information on the inspections such as date of examination, violation code for the violation committed, action taken after inspection, a critical flag indicating violation severity, and an overall inspection score.
