[["index.html", "NYC Restaurant Inspections Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC Restaurant Inspections Analysis Vishweshwar Tyagi, SeokHyun Kim 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Our motivation for choosing New York City Restaurant Inspection Results is to analyze restaurants in terms of safety unlike the general ratings in Google Map or Yelp, and to help the public make informed decisions while choosing which restaurant to eat in New York City. In the dataset we will analyze, it contains violation citation from every inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias. Since we will be on the lookout for patterns, it will also help us understand which areas in NYC are lagging in terms of safety. Hence, this dataset will help us answer the following questions: What are the most common violations committed? What are the locations in NYC that are safer? How do non-chain restaurants compare to their counterparts, i.e., chain restaurants? How does inspection score change over time? Which violation increases after COVID-19? Now, let’s dive deep into exploratory data analysis and visualization! "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Who is responsible for collecting the data? 2.2 Why and How is the data collected? 2.3 Basic information about the dataset 2.4 Issues", " Chapter 2 Data sources DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results 2.1 Who is responsible for collecting the data? NYC government’s health department conducts unexpected inspections for restaurants in New York City at least once a year. During COVID-19 before August 14 2021, the inspection was stopped but now the NYC Health Department is conducting full inspections, including issuing letter grades and summonses subject to fines. 2.2 Why and How is the data collected? All restaurants are required to be in compliance with NYS and NYC Food Safety Regulations, found in New York City Health Code Article 81. By inspection, health department want to check that restaurants comply with food safety rules. Violations of food safety rules have point values for each item, and total score of restaurant results in a specific letter grade. The lower the score, the better the grade. 2.3 Basic information about the dataset The dataset contains details on violation citations against restaurants from every inspection conducted by the NYC government.It includes inspection results for active restaurants for the last three years. Inactive restaurants and any violations cited during the inspection that were dismissed during adjudication are excluded. Here is the basic information of dataset and each variable. Update Frequency : Daily Num of records : 383,199 Agency: Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Each row is a : Restaurant Citations 2.4 Issues Records are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. This records can make errors when analyzing the data. So we will handle this records in ‘Data transformation’ Chapter.

But if we look at plots in detail, the most common pattern is the one that has no missing values, followed by the pattern with missing values only in the ‘grade’ column. These two cases account for almost all of the most frequent missing patterns. We can also infer from the upper side plot that ‘grade’ has about 50% of its missing values and all other columns have relatively much fewer proportions of missing values. Since there are so many rows with missing values in ‘grade’, dropping these rows would not make sense. Instead, we will try to impute the ‘grade’ column values by finding exciting patterns in the dataset in further exploration. Let us now try to see how many rows have a given number of missing values. We can see that most of the rows in our dataset either have no missing values or have exactly one missing value. The reason for this is evident from the missing-patterns plot we showed above; since the column ‘grade’ has so many missing values. This will be fixed when we impute the values for ‘grade’. We will consider dropping rows with more than five missing values; this is reasonable as these rows are relatively less in quantity. To better understand the pattern of missing values, we have to check for any placeholders for missing values. A nice strategy for this is to look for outliers. Let us try to see when most of the inspections were conducted. Here, we can see that the inspection date with year = 1900 is an outlier and possibly a placeholder for missing values. We confirm below by analyzing the missing patterns of the subset of our dataset with the inspection year 1900. We can see that most of the data in rows with the inspection year equal to 1900 is missing. Therefore, we will consider dropping these rows. Let us try to understand if there’s any relation between missing-patterns and borough. ## [1] Queens Brooklyn Manhattan Bronx Staten Island ## Levels: Bronx Brooklyn Manhattan Queens Staten Island We can see that none of these seem to display any relation between missing-patterns and boroughs, which is worth investigating further. 4.1 Transformation We drop the rows that have 1900 as their inspection year ## camis dba boro street zip cuisine ## 1 41170643 LITTLE MOROCCO RESTAURANT Queens STEINWAY STREET 11103 Moroccan ## 2 41610426 GLOW THAI RESTAURANT Brooklyn 3 AVENUE 11209 Thai ## 3 41711813 BEDFORD FALLS Manhattan EAST 67 STREET 10065 American ## 4 41429907 MARIO&#39;S DELI Brooklyn NASSAU AVENUE 11222 American ## 5 41624260 ZENG&#39;S RESTAURANT Brooklyn FOURTH AVENUE 11232 Chinese ## 6 41530091 JOY &amp; SNOOK RESTAURANT AND BAKERY Brooklyn NOSTRAND AVENUE 11216 Caribbean ## insp_date action vio_code ## 1 2019-11-04 violations 05H ## 2 2019-08-29 violations 08A ## 3 2016-07-22 violations 10I ## 4 2019-08-30 violations 04F ## 5 2018-12-10 violations 06D ## 6 2017-10-03 violations 22F ## vio_desc ## 1 No facilities available to wash, rinse and sanitize utensils and/or equipment. ## 2 Facility not vermin proof.

In this Results chapter, we will answer various questions about violation and safety of New York City Restaurants. 5.1 Major Violations Firstly, we want to check out what are the most common violations committed. Let’s pick the major violations of restaurant in NYC. According to the pie chart and description table above, we can check that the most common violation is code 10F, which indicates ‘Non-food contact surface improperly constructed. Unacceptable material used…’. It’s really dangerous from the first item. If you look at the 4th highest violation (code 6C), it’s surprising that the food and ingredients we eat in restaurants are often exposed to contamination. Also, there are many places where mice appear (code 04L). But don’t worry. Through the analysis, we will help you avoid these violated restaurants. 5.2 Borough We’ll firstly figure out which borough gets better grade in inspection. Keep in mind that A is better grade than B, and B is better grade than C. N, P, Z mean not yet graded or grade pending issued. Look at the stacked bar-chart above. Though the proportion of each borough is not significantly different in grade A, B, C, but still, it can be seen that the proportion of Manhattan is highest in grade A. On the other hand, Brooklyn accounts for a high proportion in grade B or C. Therefore, if you are looking for an borough to eat, we recommend Manhattan! Then the next thing we are curious about is What are the locations in NYC that have a large number of critical violations? Even if the number of violations is the same, if the violation is serious, you will definitely want to avoid that area. New York City’s inspection report provides information on whether the violation was serious or not, and I was able to create the graph above through this info. But the rate of critical violations does not seem to vary significantly from borough to borough. Fortunately, you don’t have to consider this part much when choosing restaurant. 5.3 Chain vs Non-Chain Let’s solve other interesting question this time. Which one do you think is safer, a chain restaurant or a non-chain restaurant? The results were somewhat surprising. Before checking the box plot, note that the higher the violation score is, the more serious the violation is. So the higher violation score means that restaurant is less safe. As a result, non-chain restaurants tended to have higher violation score than chain restaurants in all regions! Presumably, chain restaurants with integrated management pay a bit more attention to hygiene or storage of food. If you want to have a hygienic meal in New York City, you are more likely to have what you want to by going to a chain restaurant. 5.4 Cuisine Category If so, how about the category of cuisine? Will the violation score differ depending on the type of restaurant? We can easily check this out through the Cleveland Dot Plot. To avoid errors due to a small number of samples, only categories with more than 100 samples were selected. A distinct difference is observed than expected. Because each category of cuisine has a different way of cooking and handling ingredients, there must be restaurants that are exposed to environments that are prone to violation. The graph above clearly shows that. If then, we also want to know that the proportion of cuisine in each grade affected by borough. We will create a mosaic plot (which is basically a faceted stacked bar chart) showing all three variables. We chose top 5 category of cuisine to secure enough sample size. Clearly, you can see that the proportion of cuisine in each grade varies for each borough. Especially, if you want to eat chinese, I recommend not to eat in Bronx borough because a lot portion of grade C Chinese restaurant is there! 5.5 Score Change over Time Now, let’s take a look at how the violation score of restaurants changes over time. A few interesting things can be noticed in the graph. Note that one line in the graph represents the score change of one restaurant over time. First of all, it can be ascertained that serious violations are immediately remedied. In the graph, the violations over score 40 are improved right after the inspection. In addition, when looking at the overall trend of lower scores, it is estimated that restaurants are making some effort to improve safety. 5.6 After COVID-19 we cannot leave out the analysis about COVID-19. Which violation increases after COVID-19 do you think? It seems that there is a period between 2020-2021 where the inspection was not conducted due to the corona virus. To see what kinds of violations increased when the inspection was resumed, a trend line was drawn on the scatter plot above. The clearly increasing violation item is code 08A which indicates ‘Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.’ according to the description table. Due to the long shutdown period, the facilities that prevent vermin are not being managed well. 5.7 Total Inspections in New York City We can see that 2019 recorded the most number of inspections. We see a sudden drop in inspections post that, which could be attributed to the spread of Covid-19. Most frequently carried out inspections are the initial ones followed by re-inspections. 5.8 Consistency of Inspections We can see that inspections were carried out on a consistent basis till the start of 2020. The number of inspections carried out during the weekdays were roughly the same. We see a sharp drop after the start of 2020. This was roughly the time of Covid onset. We see things are healing back to normal towards the mid of 2021. 5.9 Inspections in New York City - Borough Level Manhattan seems to have the majority of inspections in any given year. We can also see that most inspections were carried out in 2019. However, the proportion of inspections carried out in each borough remains roughly the same every year. This could mean that out of all the inspections which are to be carried out in a given year, the New York government has fixed ratios for each borough. For example, it seems like it is never the case that for a particular year Staten Island will be given more attention than Manhattan. We see that the proportion of inspections carried out varies immensely by the boroughs, however, they are carried out on a consistent basis. We again see a sharp drop similar to one of the above plots. 5.10 Frequent Violations We can see that Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens account for the majority of these violations and have roughly the same share. This makes sense because most of the inspections are also carried out in these boroughs. More number of violations in a borough need not necessarily mean the place is unsafe, instead, it means that regular checks are in place to ensure safety. We will confirm this below. 5.11 Sentiment Analysis In order to understand the sentiment behind these violations, we analyse the word cloud for the most frequent words that occur in their violation description. We can see that the sentiment displayed by these violation codes is mostly against the hygiene and safety standards of the restaurants. 5.12 Borough - Grade - Flag - Three Way Analysis We can see that the most frequently awarded grade after an inspection is grade A and Manhattan has the majority share of it. The share of critical flags in each of these boroughs is roughly around 50%, that is, for each of these boroughs, the outcome of an inspection is equi-likely to be either critical or non-critical, however, the most likely grade is A. This tells us that flag is not really dependent on grade. It is possible for a restaurant to have committed a critical violation but overall they have maintained high standards and received grade A. 5.13 Relationship Between Score and Grade Here, we can see a strong relation between score and grade. Restaurants with inspections score between 0-13 received grade A, followed by B grade for score in 14-27 and grade C for score greater than 27. This means that score is inversely proportional to safety standards and hygiene. 5.14 Frequent Offenders - By Critical Violations We can see that among the chain restaurants, Dunkin is by has the most critical violations. It has roughly the same number of outlets in the boroughs excluding Staten Island. It is interested to see where the non-chain violators are located aswell. 5.15 Favourite Cuisine We see that ‘American’ cuisine is by the most favorite in New York City. We also see that Manhattan has the majority proportions of almost all the top cuisines, making itself more attractive to New Yorkers by offering diversity.
